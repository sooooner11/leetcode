25.reverse nodes in group (write)

4.median of two sorted arrays
 	  Median can divide array into to arrays with same length. We can choose the shorter array and use binary search.Searching i in [0, m], to find an object `in` that:B[j-1] <= A[i] and A[i-1] <= B[j], ( where j = (m + n + 1)/2 - i )
	a.If(B[j-1] <= A[i] and A[i-1] <= B[j]) we find the median.
	b.If(B[j-1]>A[i])  lo=mid+1;
	c.Else hi=mid-1;

5. Longest Palindromic Substring
   1.check every single character if they can be the median of the palindromic substring

11. Container With Most Water
	Two pointer,i and j,pointing to start and end.Count the capacity and move the shorter one.

15. 3Sum
	Skipping the duplicate number can remove the duplicate answer.Because the first duplicated number contains all the possible solution

22. Generate Parentheses
	if(left<n) can appedn("("),then backtrack, and if(left>right) can append(")")

31. Next Permutation
	a.start from the last element,find a[i]<a[i+1]
	b.swap a[i] and the smallest element than larger than a[i] in a[i+1]~a[n-1]
	c.reverse a[i+1]~a[n-1]
